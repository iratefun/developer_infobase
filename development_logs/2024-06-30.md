- [ ] Continue work on abraxas.
- [ ] Clean Up/Finish ProjectCoreBuilder class.
- [x] Create shared runnable start script (prcr__runnable_entry_point__util) so that all applications can use a common loader script.  The goals is to have all applications define their origin as a ProjectCoreRunnable class rather than an (async function(){}){}
- [ ] Start work on prcr__sisyphus__runnable project.  This program will serve the purpose of performing administrative and repetitive tasks.  Things like auto-committing/pushing git repositories to ensure code is always uploaded.
