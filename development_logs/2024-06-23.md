Goals

# Builder Application

We need an application to build projects.  Up until now we've relied on projects having their own build scripts using esbuild or webpack, but it's become maintainence hell.  We should have one standard application that takes one standard build configuration that builds one standard output package.  The underlying packager, whether it be esbuild, or webpack, or even electron, should be agnostic to the builder application.

A package output must have a load manifest.  That manifest should contain instructions on whether or not to load the package from the development environment, or compiled sources.

# Development Configuration Script

We need a parent configuration script for all development.  It cannot be a JSON file, as we've tried that in the past, and we wind up needing dynamiticity.  It must contain relevant paths,

*Default Path*
~/development/configs/workspace/{hostname}__irfdev_config.js
