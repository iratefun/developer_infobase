# Node HTTP MITM Server Semi-Rewrite

- [x] Stripped out typescript and confirmed it's still working.
- [x] Analyzed code base and reformatted code to make it look to our standard.
- [ ] Moved code to their own respective classes.
    - [x] HTTPMITMProxyFinalRequesFilter.class.js
    - [x] HTTPMITMProxyFinalResponseFilter.class.js
    - [x] HTTPMITMCertificateAuthority.class.js
    - [x] HTTPMITMProxy.class.js
- [x] Renamed classes to be more distinct and relative to the HTTP MITM project to prevent potential confusion with other classes in the class library.
- [x] removed instances of "self" and replaced them with classname_ref.
- [ ] Make callbacks work linearly using async/await instead of async.forEach.  We want to do this to guarantee the order in which callbacks are executed.  We never want a situation where they are not executed in the order they are run.
