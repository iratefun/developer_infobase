## Project Folder Naming convention

## Project Prefixes

### PRCR

Projects prefixed with prcr/PRCR are core projects (project core).  These are used as a
baseline to build other projects.

### PTUSA

Projects prefixed with ptusa/PTUSA are projects developed for the previously valid, pentestusa entity.  That entity is currently disolved, making the ptusa prefix present, but invalid.

### IRF/IRATEFUN

Projects prefixed with irf/IRF/iratefun/IRATEFUN are my current personal projects.


## Project Suffixes
