# GIT Controlled Projects

Most projects I've developed currently utilize git control.  They weren't always controlled, simply because I was the only and primary developer on these projects, and any slowdown in writing code feels like halting the manic nature of the artistic process.  I've matured over the years, and now find source control practically mandatory.
