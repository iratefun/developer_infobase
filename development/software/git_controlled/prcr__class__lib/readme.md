# prcr__class__lib

This project core library contains classes which are not absolutely proprietary to an individual project.  What this means is, unless a class will, and can, have no other use except to the project it's used in, the class should exist in this library.

The reason for this somewhat extreme view, is the "inventors shed" development ideal.  I, as a programmer, seek invention.  This library is intended to be a shelf with parts that I can choose, and use, and integrate.  The more general parts that are obviously available and ready, the easier the process of combination, and in-turn invention, becomes.

## Vestigiality Notes

This project used to be just the generic "utility classes" folder, and did not adhere to  our development axioms.  For this reason, it keeps it's dependencies in the "process.ptusa_utility_classes_internal" object.  We will be aiming to change this.

- [ ] identify and update all references of ptusa_utility_classes_internal.
