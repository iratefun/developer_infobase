# Rhetorical Devices

These are a list of rhetorical devices which may be used conversationally.

## Agree And Amplify
When a faulty point is being made, extrapolate the point to its extremes to find its breaking point.  Its similar to a slippery slope, but the goal is to push up the slope, agreeing with the person whos making the argument.  This device is useful for finding wherein an argument falls apart.  If yourself, or someone else, is arguing for something that seems perposterous, agree with the argument, and then just continue to agree but move the argument to the next logical step until the logic of the initial argument fails.
