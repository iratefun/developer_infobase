# Math Refresher Progress

I intend to complete all available math courses on Khan Academy as a matter of both refreshing and furthering my capabilities in the domain of math.  This folder intends to track my progress.

The number of courses available is reasonable, and after googling a bit it seems the correct progression for Khan Academy courses is: Algebra 1 -> Geometry -> Algebra 2 -> AP®︎/College Statistics -> Precalculus -> Differential Calculus -> Integral Calculus -> Multivariable Calculus
