# Things to remember about algebra.

* A variable can be zero.  Dividing by zero is erroneous.
* With regards to inequalities (less than, greater than form), if you are multiplying or dividing by a negative on both sides, the inequality needs to be flipped (eg > becomes < ) 
* Degree/minute/second conversions
  * 60 minutes = one degree. 
  * 60 seconds = one minute. 
  * 3600 seconds = one degree
