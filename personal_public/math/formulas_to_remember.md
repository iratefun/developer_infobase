# Math Formulas

Things I'd like to have memorized at all times, like party tricks.  I've always been able to reason my way through nearly every problem I've encountered, but this is insufficient.  I need to invest the time to memorize formulas and data tables.  This markdown entry will hold those I'd like to learn.

## Pre-Algebra

### Constants Of Proportionality / slope
* y/x=k
* y=kx
  
## Calculate Slope From Two Points
* (y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)
  
## Linerar Algebra: Slope Intercept Form
* y = mx+b
  
## Linear Algebra: Point Slope Form
Both of the following are the same, they're just written ( the _ character denotes subscript)
* y - b = m(x - a)
* (y - y_1) = m(x - x_1)
  
## Linear Algebra: Standard Form
* ax + by =  c
* -a/b = m 
* y intercept = c/b

Point of intersection: Where two lines converge on a single point.

## Linear Systems of Equations

Linear systems of equations, or systems of lines, are pairs of linear equations that are grouped together.
They can have either one, none, or infinitely many shared points.

Converting linear equations to slope-intercept form is the easiest way to solver for them.

The term 'consistent' means that a linear system has one or more points shared.
The term 'inconsistent' means that a linear system has no points shared (aka parallel lines)

The term 'independent' means that a linear system has only one point of intersection.
The term 'dependent' means that a linear system has infinite points of intersectiosn (aka they are the same line).


# Algebra 
* 

### Rate and Distance

* rate = distance / time 
* distance = rate x time

### Work

work = force / distance

### Triangles

length of hypotenuse of a right triangle = sqrt(a^2 + b^2) where a and be are lengths of the triangles sides.

### Volumes and Areas

These formulas have to do with figuring out areas and volumes of objects.

#### area for circle
area = pi * r^2

note: area can be a base for right objects

#### Calculate Volume for Squareish Objects

volume = base * height

#### Calculate Volume For Pyramind

volume = (A * h) / 3

#### Cylinder Specific Volume 
 v = pi * r^2 * h
