# Math Formulas

Things I'd like to have memorized at all times, like party tricks.  I've always been able to reason my way through nearly every problem I've encountered, but this is insufficient.  I need to invest the time to memorize formulas and data tables.  This markdown entry will hold those I'd like to learn.

## Pre-Algebra

### Constants Of Proportionality / slope
* y/x=k
* y=kx
  
## Linerar Algebra: Slope Intercept Form
* y = mx+b
  
## Linear Algebra: Point Slope Form
* y - b = m(x - a)
  
## Linear Algebra: Standard Form
* ax + by = c

# Algebra

### Rate and Distance

* rate = distance / time 
* distance = rate x time

### Work

work = force / distance

### Triangles

length of hypotenuse of a right triangle = sqrt(a^2 + b^2) where a and be are lengths of the triangles sides.

### Volumes and Areas

These formulas have to do with figuring out areas and volumes of objects.

#### area for circle
area = pi * r^2

note: area can be a base for right objects

#### Calculate Volume for Squareish Objects

volume = base * height

#### Calculate Volume For Pyramind

volume = (A * h) / 3

#### Cylinder Specific Volume 
 v = pi * r^2 * h
