# About

Some node modules have been modified/patched from their original versions.

## SVGCaptcha

The first of which is the svgcaptcha package.  It was modified because the captchas were easily solvable.  To fix this we had
to make several modifications to the package which introduced a lot of entropy into places which would make the captchas much 
more difficult to solve progrmatically.

## node-http-mitm-proxy

This package has been modified to prevent some error messages, and to allow us to intercept websocket connections.  The package itself is
in typescript, so it's currently something which must be built.
